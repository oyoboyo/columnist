What are habits? Forming the ultimate habits require we consider how a list of things we might accomplish is limited by only our ability to adopt them. Carefully considering what constitutes a good habit may differ from even the most self-explanatory consideration.

To carry ourselves with the right mindset, we need only look towards the best race car drivers. Going fast takes you around a track quickly, but it doesn't keep you from crashing. That requires we act mindfully in the way we control our motor vehicle. This is an important metaphor. Getting to the bottom of what control looks like for us is how habits form meaningfully.

# Meaningful habits

Not all habits are made the same. Some have the distinction of not being very good, infant, [there are bad habits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit#Bad_habits) and many are not good. Some however, offer us unique insight into the nature of being (but only if we consider carefully the implication of their pursuit). This is not a particularly meaningful consideration given the nature of habits, but if we take a second to deepen our understanding, many new things become apparent, for example:

- Not all habits are easy
- Most are hard, and require careful time management
- All habits are ongoing meaning consistency is key

This might not be immediately intuitive. It's only when we step back from ourselves that we find a more meaningful course towards habit formation. Registering our concerns we might find the route to a our path is set before we set out ourselves. This is not destined, but instead ordained — _in that it can not specifically end our course before it begins_.

Far from a philosophical mind game, this theory holds that the best method of internalizing our sense of ownership over our destiny is to make use of a plan. But how, does a plan take hold?

## Potential actions

While a number of things might be considered first one must identify the specific actions that lead to the outcomes which one desires. It's only through careful synthesis that a new picture of what has been established can emerge.

There are many activities one might adopt to get there:

1. Make a list of the things you do
2. Take stock of what you do not
3. Synthesize what can you do, to undo, the doing

All of these factors play into what we might call the _instance of time_ whereby we select a cadence to etablish habit inside of a matrix (or matrices) for further analysis. Some however, offer us unique insight into the nature of being Registering our concerns we might find the route to a our path is set before we set out ourselves.

## Following through

Of course this means nothing without a consistency. If we keep to a regular schedule, it may see self evident that this schedule is what is keeping us on track. It is however also important to factor in personal resolve.

When we become more resilient we tend to see things in ways that are much more effective, for example, we might begin by feeling quite incomplete, and yet arrive at a sense of completeness through the mere consideration of our faults. Unlikely, but perhaps there is something to this.

Is it intrinsic that the morning time, rather then day time offers us some kind of respite? Only if we expect there to be a reason for that kind of duality. Mostly, however the day can be split into key segments each with it's own interval. Then and only then is there something we can take away from our successes.

# Better habits

This is all to say, that the best way to be better at forming habits, is to make forming habits a habit. It's never easy, but perusing with consistency is the route forward. Making sense of this paradox requires we consider: what was the reason I wanted to form habits in the first place?

This reason is how we establish our _why._ Why is our essential purpose, it's the thing that drives us. Ensuring our habits are rooted in this is the best way to ensure habits stick — regardless of if the habits are daily, weekly, or for the rest of your life.
